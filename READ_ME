Angular-Routes-Solo
Hey everybody!

In this assignment we will be using Angular Routes to display information
on 3 political candidates of your choice. Your page should have a header
and footer of some kind, and 3 buttons to swap out the content of the candidates.

Sample candidates:

Bernie Sanders
Hilary Clinton
Martin O'Malley
Marco Rubio
Donald Trump
Ted Cruz

Feel free to use Google for the content, or make up your own!

Hard Mode
